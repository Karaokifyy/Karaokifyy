# Sprint 1

## User Stories
### Primary Feature

- As a person who casually enjoys karaoke, I want to be able to search for my favorite song by name and/or artist so
  that I can have fun singing my favorite song.

- As a karaoke enthusiast, I want to connect to my Spotify account so that I don’t have to tediously search for each
  song that I want the karaoke version of.

- I want to be able to choose a song from my library or an entire playlist.

- As a user who regularly hosts karaoke events, I want to be able to change the queue/skip songs in my playlist so
  that I can have control of what plays.


### Secondary Feature

- As a music lover, I would like a service that could create or find karaoke versions for obscure songs or new releases
  that don’t have official karaoke versions so that I can enjoy them like other, more popular songs.

- As a member of the karaoke community, I want to be able to create and submit time-synchronized lyrics of requested
  songs to the service’s database so that I can contribute to the community.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want a visually appropriate interface for the current song playing so I can feel the mood or atmosphere.

- Colors/animations that match high or low pitch and/or mood of the song, bouncing ball, words scrolling across the
  screen, etc.

## Issues

### Issues Completed

### Issues In Progress

#### Front-end: 

I was unable to create a HTTP service to the server in time of sprint 1. I could get a service running to a json placeholder as a moch backend but I still need to het it running with the actual go code. I believe I was unable to complete this task in time due to the face that the original setup/installations as well as creating the login screen to most of the time. For the next sprint I will plan better to get more productive in terms of a proper HTTP service from clien to server.

#### Back-end:
