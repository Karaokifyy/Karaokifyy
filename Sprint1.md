## User Stories
### Primary Feature

- As a person who casually enjoys karaoke, I want to be able to search for my favorite song by name and/or artist so
  that I can have fun singing my favorite song.

- As a karaoke enthusiast, I want to connect to my Spotify account so that I don’t have to tediously search for each
  song that I want the karaoke version of.

- I want to be able to choose a song from my library or an entire playlist.

- As a user who regularly hosts karaoke events, I want to be able to change the queue/skip songs in my playlist so
  that I can have control of what plays.


### Secondary Feature

- As a music lover, I would like a service that could create or find karaoke versions for obscure songs or new releases
  that don’t have official karaoke versions so that I can enjoy them like other, more popular songs.

- As a member of the karaoke community, I want to be able to create and submit time-synchronized lyrics of requested
  songs to the service’s database so that I can contribute to the community.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want a visually appropriate interface for the current song playing so I can feel the mood or atmosphere.

- Colors/animations that match high or low pitch and/or mood of the song, bouncing ball, words scrolling across the
  screen, etc.

## Issues
- General:
  - Sign up our web app with spotify 
  - Communicate between front-end and back-end
- Front-end:
  - Setup an initial Angular project
  - Have a HTTP service with a mock backend(jsonplace holder)
  - Create basic skeleton for front-page (search bar, "sign up with spotify button")
- Back-end:
  - Get a back-end GO Server up and running
  - Connect to spotify API using access token
  - Retrieve public track info
  - Set up foundation to accesss private user songs and playlist info (i.e. Authorization Code Flow for OAuth 2)
  - Figure a way to serve front-end (angular, typescript, etc) pages through our GO server

### Issues Completed
  - Get a back-end GO Server up and running
  - Connect to spotify API using access token
  - Retrieve public track info
  - Create basic skeleton for front-page (search bar, "sign up with spotify button")
### Issues In Progress
The issues that weren't completed were because most of our efforts were spent acquiring inital knowledge and other aspects of the learning curve
- Communication between front-end and back-end:
  - Indecision on which method to pursue
