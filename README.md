## Project Name
Karaokifyy

## Project Description
The basis for the website/platform centers around providing users karaoke versions of their favorite songs or Spotify playlists, especially for ones that don't already have an official or fan-made version readily available. Our main feature will link to the user's Spotify and pull the song(s)'s metadata using Spotify's Web API, find the matching instrumental through YouTube's Data API, and lastly play that instrumental via an IFrame while displaying the time-synchronized lyrics pulled from our database. The secondary feature focuses on crowdsourcing the time-synchronized lyrics through an easy-to-use interface involving the volunteer highlighting parts of the lyrics that are currently being played from the original version.
