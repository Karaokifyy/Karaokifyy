## Front-end

We added unit tests using the ```.spec.ts``` files for each component of our app. These tests verified that the components were rendered correctly and our HTTP requests were recieving valid json data. We made sure to make a 1 to 1 ratio for these tests to make sure that everything is working as intended. 

For this Sprint, we used Cypress tests to verify an OAuth Login and Authentication with a 3rd party(in our case spotify). Utilizing this test, we were able simulate running our application in new tests by choosing a valid playlist and song to demo our work, which leads to our end kareoke screen with time synchronized lyrics and a correct youtube iframe. We also used cypress to look for the correct lyrics on the screen to validate that the output was correct(depending on the song).

### Issues Completed
   - Get lyrics of songs from database based off spotify song IDs  
   - Displayed time synchronized lyrics in accordance to iframe video 
   - Fixed CORS errors from Sprint 3
   - Updated UI of application
